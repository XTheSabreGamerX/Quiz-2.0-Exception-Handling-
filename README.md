# Quiz-2.0-Exception-Handling

This program was a pain in the ass to make. But with perseverance and determination, I ascended into my final form! Well not exactly. This was inspired mostly by my 1st year 1st semester quiz program. I took that concept and decided to revise it finally using methods and user-defined exception handling. I was mostly stuck in stopping the for loop of the quiz. It would just keep going even though the user answered all 10 questions contained in the questions array. However, after an hour of debugging, I pretty much did it!
